# Zink — Development and recovery log

Repository: [Zeus97x/Zink](https://github.com/Zeus97x/Zink)  
Default branch at initialization: `master`

This is the running technical record for ChatGPT/Codex to recover context, understand how changes were made and resume work. Keep entries in chronological order and update with every meaningful change. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for maintenance rules. The same standard applies to future Zeus websites in GitHub.

## Recovery starting point

- Inspect current Git source and history before acting on historical notes.
- Baseline before this log: [c5ce8fda346cf3ad98fbe2d228ff024ce7c1c3ed](https://github.com/Zeus97x/Zink/commit/c5ce8fda346cf3ad98fbe2d228ff024ce7c1c3ed). Recover committed files by checking out that commit or a later verified checkpoint; do not overwrite newer source with an old ZIP.
- Source directories and project configuration are present. Buildability and runtime behavior were not tested in this documentation task.
- Earlier work is documented in the references below and Git history. This initialization does not claim a complete reconstruction of past changes; backfill only from verified source, diffs and existing handoffs, with provenance.

## 2026-10-08 — Initialize shared recovery record

- Request: keep a running Markdown record for all apps and future GitHub websites so development can resume if chat context or files are lost.
- Changed: added `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`; created `AGENTS.md`.
- How: documented the current Git checkpoint, repository contents and existing history references; required future work to record implementation details and verification alongside source changes. Existing project instructions and history are preserved.
- Affected files: `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
- Verification: read the default-branch root contents, existing root agent instructions and baseline Git commit. Documentation only; no application tests or build were run. Confirm the committed documents by reading them back after publication.
- Remaining: prior implementation details have not been backfilled; use the existing history and commits as evidence. Record subsequent work here with exact affected paths.
- Next step: read this record together with the relevant handoff/phase files, inspect current source, and proceed with the user's next authorized task.

## Entry template for future work

Copy this template for a new dated entry; replace every placeholder with facts.

### YYYY-MM-DD — Change or phase name

- Status: implemented / in progress / blocked / planned.
- Request/problem and reason:
- Changes:
- Implementation (how and important decisions):
- Affected files and configuration names (no secret values):
- References: baseline/source commit, PR, build/release, related notes as applicable. A commit cannot contain its own final SHA; use the baseline or add the resulting reference in a later entry.
- Verification: commands/checks actually run and their results; state what was not tested.
- Remaining issues/blockers:
- Recovery/resume: exact next step and any compatibility or migration details needed to continue safely.
